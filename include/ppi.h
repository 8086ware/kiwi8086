// PPI modes:
// 0 - Simple input or output mode
// In this mode, A and B are 2 simple io ports but C is split into 2 4 bit ports.
// Outputs are latched, inputs are not latched. Ports can't interrupt or handshake
// can only operate in mode 0 for now

// 1 - Input or output with handshake
// handshake signals between peripherals. Ports are simple 2 8 bit ports.
// port C is used for hand shake signals. Specifically 2 (A and B) 3 bit lines. Remaining 2 bit is for i/o operations (simple)
// Input and Output are latched

// 2 - Bidirectional data transfer mode
// Usually used in data transfer between computers.
// Port A is configured as bidirectional, and Port B in mode 1 or 0.
// Port A uses five signals from Port C as handshake signals for data transfer
// Remaining three signals from Port C is simple IO or handshake for port B.
